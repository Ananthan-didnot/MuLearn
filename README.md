# üå± MuLearn Projects

This repository consolidates a collection of mini-projects and exercises created as part of my learning journey through the **MuLearn** community and web development practice.

Each project was previously maintained in a separate repository, and has now been merged here for easier access, reference, and collaboration. The full commit history of each project has been preserved.
